Unemployment Analysis During COVID-19 in India

Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on unemployment trends across India. Using publicly available datasets, we explore how the pandemic influenced job losses, sector-wise employment changes, and recovery patterns over time. The analysis helps in understanding the socio-economic effects of the pandemic and supports data-driven policy recommendations.

Objectives
Collect and clean unemployment and labor force data from credible sources (e.g., government reports, CMIE, surveys).
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and patterns in unemployment rates during different phases of the pandemic.
Analyze sector-wise employment changes, focusing on industries severely impacted by lockdowns and restrictions.
Visualize the temporal evolution of unemployment across states and demographic groups (age, gender, urban/rural).
Apply statistical methods and machine learning techniques to forecast short-term unemployment trends.
Provide actionable insights to assist policymakers and stakeholders in recovery planning.

Key Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning to handle missing and inconsistent data.
Comprehensive EDA with interactive and static visualizations (line plots, bar charts, heatmaps).
Trend analysis of monthly/quarterly unemployment rates during 2020-2022.
Sector-wise and regional comparison of employment impacts.
Forecasting using time-series models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet).
Detailed documentation of methodology and findings.
